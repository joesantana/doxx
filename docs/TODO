NEW:

High Priority
  -- support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives
  -- add try/except blocks around stderr issues in multi-template multiprocessing builds (the outputlock is not being released when exception raised)
  -- pull command: change 'project.yaml' to 'key.yaml' following pull

Medium Priority
  -- analyze: analyze a template or key file or .tar.gz package
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?

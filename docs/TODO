ROADMAP:

High Priority
  [ ] docs: command - open default web browser to the documentation site for commands
  [ ] improve: vs. view: simple access to repository to improve the templates/keys
  [ ] Travis testing of package builds
  [ ] mechanism for new package build requests/submissions

Medium Priority
  -- create an approach that permits users to distribute their packages on their own GH repos similar to Package Repo
  -- pull from CDNJS with shorthand path (project/version/etc)
  -- ? create a settings file so users can create their own shortcode specs
  -- pre-build and post-build script execution support (task runner style)
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?
  
Maybe?
  -- pull from other repositories like BitBucket?
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  -- summary: view a summary of key or template file in the terminal

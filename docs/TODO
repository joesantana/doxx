TESTS:
 -- build - [] multi-file
            [] multi-file remote
            [] tar.gz project
            [] tar.gz project remote
            [] .zip project
            [] .zip project remote
            [] verbatim template builds (no replacements)
            [] empty key builds (no replacements)
           
 [X] clean
 [X] pack
 [X] unpack
 [X] pull
 [X] make
 
 
BUGS:

[X] missing key fields are replaced with "None" - fix


NEW:

High Priority
  -- modify key file to permit absence of replacement data (i.e. project builds that do not require templating)
  -- support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives

Medium Priority
  -- analyze: analyze a template or key file or .tar.gz package
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?

            [X] verbatim template builds (no replacements)
            [] empty key builds (no replacements)
            [] project archive error tests - bad URL's, incorrect files in projects, etc
           
 [X] clean

BUGS:



NEW:

High Priority
  --  add try/except blocks to project archive runs
  --  add support for official repo projects (test for no tar.gz or .zip filename in project: value)
  --  create a project class under datatypes, maintain URL paths to the official repository
  [X] support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives
  [X] remove the tar.gz or .zip file following the build with a project archive file
  [X] remove project.yaml and pkey.yaml files with clean command
  [X] add project subcommand to `make` command (add project files/directories)
  [-] (will not add, avoid overwrite of local key.yaml) pull command: change 'pkey.yaml' to 'key.yaml' following pull

Medium Priority
  -- pull project specific keys to local directories (raw text pkey.yaml pull from GitHub) - use `doxx pull key` command?
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  -- automated builds and pulls from official GitHub project repository
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?

BUGS:



NEW:

High Priority
  [X] support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives
  [X] remove the tar.gz or .zip file following the build with a project archive file
  -- remove project.yaml and pkey.yaml files with clean command
  -- add project subcommand to `make` command (add project files/directories)
  -- pull command: change 'pkey.yaml' to 'key.yaml' following pull

Medium Priority
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  -- pull project specific keys to local directories (raw text pkey.yaml pull from GitHub) - use `doxx make key` command?
  -- automated builds and pulls from official GitHub project repository
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?

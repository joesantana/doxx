BUGS:



NEW:

High Priority
  [X] support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives

  -- add project subcommand to make command (add project files/directories)
  -- pull command: change 'pkey.yaml' to 'key.yaml' following pull

Medium Priority
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  
Low Priority

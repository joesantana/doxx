BUGS:



NEW:

High Priority
  
  --  whatis command - display the description of the package archive files
  --  add try/except blocks to project package runs
  --  exception handling when test remote package does not exist
  [X] change pkey.yaml to key.yaml following pulls if key.yaml does not exist
  [X] automated builds and pulls from official GitHub project repository
  [X] pull project specific keys to local directories (raw text pkey.yaml pull from GitHub) - use `doxx pullkey` command?
  [X] create a project class under datatypes, maintain URL paths to the official repository
  [X] fix filepaths for windows, need to add os.path.joins for templates/projects (clean user input)
  [X] support for builds from tar.gzip or zip compressed file archives
  [X] remove the tar.gz or .zip file following the build with a project archive file
  [X] remove project.yaml and pkey.yaml files with clean command
  [X] add project subcommand to `make` command (add project files/directories)
  [-] (will not add, avoid overwrite of local key.yaml) pull command: change 'pkey.yaml' to 'key.yaml' following pull

Medium Priority
  -- analyze: analyze a template, key file, or .tar.gz package archive
  -- view: view a key or template file in the console
  
Low Priority
  -- add bzip2 / lzma compression options to pack command?
